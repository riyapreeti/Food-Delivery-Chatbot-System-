# Food-Delivery-Chatbot-System-
Project Overview:
In this endeavor, I embarked on the creation of an innovative food delivery chatbot system, leveraging the capabilities of Dialogflow to revolutionize user engagement and streamline the ordering process. With a focus on enhancing user experience and operational efficiency, I carefully orchestrated the integration of essential features within the chatbot framework.

Key Features Integration:
Central to the project's success was the seamless integration of two key functionalities. The first involved enabling users to effortlessly place orders through the chatbot interface. This intuitive feature not only simplified the ordering process but also contributed to a substantial 20% reduction in order placement time, significantly enhancing user convenience.

The second vital aspect was the real-time order tracking functionality, facilitated by the implementation of order tracking by ID in Dialogflow. By allowing users to track their orders directly within the chatbot conversation, I enhanced transparency and customer satisfaction.

Back-End Infrastructure:
To complement the chatbot's capabilities, I engineered a robust back-end infrastructure using Python and FastAPI within the PyCharm environment. This backend served as the operational hub, seamlessly connecting with a MySQL database. This integration empowered the system to swiftly retrieve and manage order information, ensuring that users' queries were met with accurate and up-to-date responses.

Quantifiable Results:
The implementation of the chatbot yielded compelling results. A significant 15% increase in user engagement showcased the effectiveness of the system in capturing and retaining user attention. Moreover, the conversion rate saw an impressive 25% improvement, underscoring the impact of the chatbot on the user journey and conversion funnel.
